# 🧠 Real ML Roadmap – Machine Learning Projects (Level 1 to 5)

This repository contains hands-on machine learning projects following the [5-Level ML Project Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4BYXOE9SQ) by Marina Wyss.

Each level progresses in complexity — starting from small classical ML projects to full-scale deep learning systems and deployment-ready applications.

## ✅ Level 1 – Beginner Projects (Completed)

> Small, structured datasets with classical ML models

| 📄 Project                        | 📦 Description                                  | ⚙️ Algorithm               | 🎯 Accuracy |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| Iris Flower Classification       | Classify flowers into 3 species based on petal/sepal size | Logistic Regression      | 100%        |
| MNIST Digit Classifier (8×8)     | Recognize handwritten digits from small grayscale images   | Logistic Regression      | ~97.2%      |
| Breast Cancer Detection          | Predict if a tumor is benign or malignant based on biopsy data | Logistic Regression + Balanced Weights | ~95.6%      |

📂 See detailed breakdown here: [`level-1/README.md`](level-1/README.md)
