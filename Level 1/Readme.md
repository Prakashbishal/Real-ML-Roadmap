# 🧠 Real ML Roadmap – Machine Learning Projects (Level 1 to 5)

This repository contains a step-by-step implementation of machine learning projects following the [5-Level ML Projects Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4BYXOE9SQ) by Marina Wyss.

Each level increases in complexity — from basic classical ML to full deep learning pipelines and deployment.

## ✅ Level 1 – Beginner Projects (Completed)

| 📄 Project                      | 📦 Description                                  | ⚙️ Algorithm           | 🎯 Accuracy |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Iris Flower Classification     | Classify iris flowers into 3 species             | Logistic Regression    | 100%        |
| MNIST Digit Classifier (8×8)   | Classify 8×8 grayscale images of digits          | Logistic Regression    | ~97.2%      |
| Breast Cancer Detection        | Predict if tumor is benign or malignant          | Logistic Regression + Balanced Class Weights | ~95.6% |
